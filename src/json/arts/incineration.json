When a Unit starts their turn on one of those squares, they take ½ your Mag - the target’s Res. Fire Wall Variant: Fire Wall deals damage when a Unit ends their turn adjacent to the Fire Wall square instead of Incineration’s normal effect. A Unit can only take one instance of Fire Wall damage per turn.",
