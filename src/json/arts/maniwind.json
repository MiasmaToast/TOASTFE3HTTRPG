  "description": "When casting a Wind Spell, surround yourself or an ally within 2 spaces with protective wind magic for 2 turns. Any damage taken from at least 2 spaces away while Manifest: Wind is active is reduced by the spell’s Mt + 1. Wind Wall Variant: The damage reduction of Manifest: Wind is 5 instead of the normal calculation. In addition, whenever an ally ends their turn adjacent to any Wind Wall, they gain the effects of Manifest: Wind until the start of their next turn. This consumes any and all uses of the Wind Wall spell. All Units can only gain the effects of Manifest: Wind once per casting.",
