# Character Creator for Bradley B.'s Fire Emblem: Three Houses TTRPG

## About

This webapp serves as a character creator and virtual character sheet for Bradley B.'s homebrew TTRPG based on Fire Emblem: Three Houses.

## Building

Currently, a javascript file for the definition data must be generated by running [this python script](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/build.py). The builder can then be used by opening [index.html](https://github.com/struct-rgb/feth_ttrpg_character_sheet/blob/main/index.html) in a web browser, no internet connection needed.
