  "description": "When casting a Force Spell, surround yourself or an ally within 2 spaces with pressurized kinetic energy that can absorb the brunt of damage for 1 turn. When taking damage from an attack that utilizes your or your ally’s Def, the damage is reduced by your spell’s Mt +4. Force Wall Variant: The damage reduction from Manifest: Force is 10 instead of the normal calculation. In addition, whenever an ally ends their turn adjacent to any Anima Wall, they gain the effects of Manifest: Force until the start of their next phase. All Units can only gain the effects of Manifest: Force once per casting.",
