  "description": "When casting an Ice Spell, surround yourself or an ally within 2 spaces with a thin layer of snow to soften incoming damage for 1 turn. When taking damage from an attack that utilizes your or your ally’s Res, the damage is reduced by your spell’s Mt +3. Ice Wall Variant: The damage reduction from Manifest: Ice is 10 instead of the normal calculation. In addition, whenever an ally ends their turn adjacent to any Ice Wall, they gain the effects of Manifest: Ice until the start of their next turn. This consumes any and all uses of the Ice Wall spell. All Units can only gain the effects of Manifest: Ice once per casting.",
