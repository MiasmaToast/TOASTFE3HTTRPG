  "description": "When casting a Wind Spell after initiating combat with a target, you can choose to leave a movable 3x3 area centered on the target, surrounded by heavy winds for 2 turns. Whenever a Unit besides the target ends their turn in that area, they can choose to roll a 1d100. Any bonuses the Unit might have to Investigation or Perception can be applied to this roll. Above a 50, the Sigil is spotted and can be removed as an action if the Unit who discovered the Sigil is adjacent to the target. After two turns, if the Sigil is not removed, all Units and objects (Excluding the target.) within that square take damage equal to your Mag + your spell’s Mt + any conditional Mag bonuses you possess - the foe’s Res.",
